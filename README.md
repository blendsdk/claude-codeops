# CodeOps for Claude Code

The CodeOps AI-development workflow — **9 skills + 13 slash commands + always-on coding
standards** — packaged as an installable [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).

Ported from the original [`codeops-mcp`](https://github.com/blendsdk/codeops-mcp) server (built for
Cline) to native Claude Code. The MCP server existed to load rule documents on demand so the context
window wouldn't blow up; Claude Code does that natively via **skill progressive disclosure** (only
each skill's name + description load up front, the body loads when used). So the machinery is gone
and only the knowledge remains. See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for the full migration record.

## Install (recommended): the plugin

Inside Claude Code, add this repo as a marketplace and install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add blendsdk/claude-codeops
/plugin install codeops@codeops-marketplace
```

That's it — skills, commands, **and the always-on coding standards are active immediately**. No
`CLAUDE.md` editing and no manual merge: a bundled `SessionStart` hook injects the standards into
every session automatically (see [Always-on standards](#always-on-standards) below).

> The marketplace must be added **via git** (`add <org>/<repo>`), as shown — that is what lets the
> plugin's `source: "."` resolve to the repo root. A raw-URL add will not resolve it.

## Verify it loaded

Inside Claude Code:
- Ask **"What skills are available?"** — the CodeOps skills should be listed.
- Type `/` and look for the namespaced commands `/codeops:make_plan`, `/codeops:exec_plan`,
  `/codeops:gitcm`, `/codeops:gitcmp`, … (plugin skills/commands are namespaced under `codeops:`).
- Run `/doctor` to confirm no skill descriptions are being truncated.

## Updating

This plugin uses **rolling updates** — it carries no version number, so the git commit is the
version. To pick up the latest:

```text
/plugin update codeops@codeops-marketplace
```

Every push to the repo is immediately installable; there is no version bump to wait for. A fresh
session may be needed for newly added directories to be watched.

## Uninstalling

```text
/plugin uninstall codeops@codeops-marketplace
```

Disabling or uninstalling the plugin also turns off the standards hook — there is nothing left
behind in your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to clean up (because the plugin never edited it).

## Always-on standards

The plugin bundles a single source of truth for the universal coding/testing/working-style
standards: [`standards/coding-standards.md`](standards/coding-standards.md). A `SessionStart`
hook ([`hooks/hooks.json`](hooks/hooks.json)) `cat`s that file into the context of every new
session, so the standards are always present with **zero setup**.

- This fires on every session start (including after `/clear` and context compaction).
- It is read-only — the hook only reads a file shipped inside the plugin; it never writes anything.
- To turn it off, disable the plugin. There is no separate toggle.
- If you prefer the classic approach, you *can* still merge `standards/coding-standards.md` into your
  global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by hand — but with the plugin that is unnecessary and would duplicate
  the content.

## Developing the skills (optional)

If you want to live-edit the skills themselves, there is an in-repo dev installer that symlinks the
`skills/` and `commands/` folders into `~/.claude/` so a `git pull` propagates edits with no
reinstall:

```bash
./install.sh            # symlink skills + commands into ~/.claude/ (recommended)
./install.sh --copy     # install detached copies instead of symlinks
./install.sh --dry-run  # preview, change nothing
./uninstall.sh          # reverse it (restores any backups)
./scripts/validate.sh   # pre-push guard: validates manifests, hook, standards, descriptions
```

The dev installer gives you **short** names (`/make_plan`); the plugin gives you **namespaced**
names (`/codeops:make_plan`). **Pick one — the plugin OR the dev installer, not both** — or you will
see duplicate skills. Note the dev installer does *not* install the standards hook (that is a plugin
mechanism); see [Always-on standards](#always-on-standards) for the manual-merge alternative.

## Usage at a glance

| You type / say | What happens |
|---|---|
| `make a plan` / `make_plan` | Clarifying interview → Zero-Ambiguity Gate → `plans/<feature>/` doc set |
| `exec_plan <feature> [--auto-commit]` | Implements the plan task-by-task, verifying and committing per mode |
| `make_requirements` / `add_requirement` / `review_requirements` | Requirements discovery / add one RD / health-check |
| `retro_requirements [--scope <path>]` | Reverse-engineer a codebase into a reconstruction brief |
| `grill_me [topic]` | Relentless design-disambiguation interview |
| `preflight <artifact>` | Adversarial, codebase-grounded quality audit |
| `make_techdocs` / `review_techdocs` | Create/maintain VitePress architecture docs + ADRs |
| `make_roadmap` / `update_roadmap` / … | Track a whole feature-set across its lifecycle |
| `upgrade_plan <feature>` / `upgrade_requirements` | Bring an outdated artifact to current standards |
| `/gitcm` / `/gitcmp` | Commit (and push) with a detailed Conventional Commit message |
| `/analyze_project` | Generate/refresh this project's `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/migrate_clinerules` | Convert a legacy `.clinerules/project.md` into `CLAUDE.md` |

The consolidated skills cover several verbs each, and thin **alias commands** make each verb directly
typeable (they delegate to the parent skill in the right mode): `/add_requirement`,
`/review_requirements` → `make_requirements`; `/make_techdocs`, `/review_techdocs` → `techdocs`;
`/make_roadmap`, `/update_roadmap`, `/review_roadmap`, `/archive_roadmap` → `roadmap`;
`/upgrade_requirements` → `upgrade_plan`. These aliases are manual-only — only the parent skills
auto-trigger from natural language.

The skills compose into the original CodeOps pipelines, e.g.
`grill_me → make_requirements → preflight → make_plan → preflight → exec_plan`, with `roadmap`
tracking it all and `techdocs` keeping architecture docs current.
